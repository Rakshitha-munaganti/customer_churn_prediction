# Customer Churn Prediction Project  

This project predicts whether a telecom customer will churn (leave the service) using Machine Learning.  
I used Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and Random Forest to build and evaluate the model.

## 📌 Project Objectives
- Understand customer behavior  
- Identify reasons for customer churn  
- Build a model to predict churn  
- Use Random Forest Classifier for best accuracy

## 🧠 Machine Learning Steps

### ✔ Data Cleaning  
- Checked missing values  
- Converted TotalCharges to numeric  
- Encoded categorical columns  

### ✔ Model Training  
Used *Random Forest Classifier* with class balancing.

### ✔ Model Accuracy  
- Accuracy: *0.79*  
- ROC AUC: *0.82*  
- F1 Score for churn: *0.53*
